# NomadArchitecture

My own architecture in the making. Trying to understand AI assisted development by using Copilot to define a new kind of architecture built for humans and AI alike.

> Due to life, time constraints and other hindering parameters, my ideas tended to stay in my head and eventually fade into oblivion. Then came the now infamous LLMs and their promise to replace us and take over. Will they take over? No Idea, and I'd rather they didn't. Can they be useful when used properly? I have no doubt about that! It's up to us, the users, as always.
> That said, I hope this repo will help shed some light on my vision as an architect, but also my journey in AI assist land, and how I chose to use this new technology to go beyond what I humanly could without it.
>
> I hope it can be beneficial to anyone, since it gave me so much fun already.
> Thank you in advance for everything, be it support, feedback, collaboration or even just having read those lines. 

_Now for the **disclaimer**: Most of this product will be AI generated. A curracted AI generation, AI nonetheless. To anyone having issues with AI, for personal or professional reasons, I understand if you prefer not to proceed. For the others, know that I do read every sources and texts I can, but I'm still just one man, I may miss a detail or two. Bear with me and let me know if you spot anything uncanny._

## 📘 Full Copilot Report: NomadArchitecture

Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of NomadArchitecture as I’ve come to understand it through our conversations:

---

### 🧭 Core Philosophy

NomadArchitecture is a **cultural operating system** disguised as a software architecture. It’s not just about organizing code—it’s about **transmitting worldview, ensuring continuity, and encoding human intent** into the system’s very structure.

It draws inspiration from:
- **Clean Architecture** (Uncle Bob): separation of concerns, dependency inversion.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture** (Jimmy Bogard): feature-centric modularity.
- **CQRS pragmatism** (Derek Comartin): clear command/query separation.
But it **extends** them with anthropological metaphors and cultural rituals.

### 🏗️ Canonical Skeleton

At the root of every NomadArchitecture project are five sacred pillars:

| Folder        | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Core/`       | The tribal language—portable, universal types and contracts.            |
| `Features/`   | The people—individuals, families, clans, tribes. Each feature is alive. |
| `Foundations/`| The toolboxes—logging, mapping, validation. No buckets allowed.         |
| `Hosts/`      | The skins—API, CLI, jobs. Replaceable, never the soul.                  |
| `__Docs/`     | The story trailhead—living documentation, worldview, and onboarding.    |

---

### 🧬 Key Principles

| Principle                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Features as People**       | Features are anthropomorphized: individuals (files), families (folders), clans (bounded contexts), tribes (domains). |
| **Trails as Proof of Life**  | Every feature must carry a README (why), Map (how), and Traces (what happened). |
| **No Bucketisation**         | No dumping grounds. Every file must scream its intent.                      |
| **Hosts are Replaceable**    | Delivery mechanisms (API, CLI, etc.) are skins—not the soul.                |
| **Docs as Architecture**     | Documentation is not a sidecar—it’s a parallel architecture that teaches by structure. |

---

### 🛠️ Cultural Practices

- **Worldview.md**: Explains the system’s philosophy and lineage.
- **Tribe.md**: Lists all Features and their missions.
- **Transmission.md**: Onboarding guide for new developers.
- **Rituals**: Naming conventions, folder hygiene, and documentation are treated as cultural rituals, not chores.

---

### 🧪 Testing & Continuity

- **Traces**: Real-world examples of feature execution.
- **Auditability**: Every feature leaves a trail.
- **Portability**: Features can be lifted and reused across systems.

---

### 🧱 Adaptability to Platforms

NomadArchitecture is **platform-agnostic**:
- In **C#**, it maps cleanly to folders, classes, and interfaces.
- In **Power Automate**, it manifests through modular flows, SharePoint-based `__Docs/`, and reusable connectors.
- In **microservices**, each service can be a tribe, with its own Features and Trails.

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters

NomadArchitecture ensures that:
- The system **teaches itself** to newcomers.
- The architecture **outlives the architect**.
- The codebase becomes a **living, breathing culture**, not just a technical artifact.

---

If you’d like, I can help you **package this into a shareable artifact**—like a Notion page, SharePoint wiki, or even a narrated slide deck. Or we could build a “NomadArchitecture Starter Kit” for your team. Just say the word.
